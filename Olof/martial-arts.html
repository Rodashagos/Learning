            <h2>Karate</h2>
            <p>Karate is a martial art that originated in Okinawa, Japan. It emphasizes striking techniques using fists, feet, knees, and hands. The discipline teaches not just physical techniques, but also mental fortitude and respect. Through rigorous training, practitioners develop strength, flexibility, and a strong spirit. Karate has taught me the importance of discipline and perseverance.</p>

            <h2>Self Defence</h2>
            <p>Self-defence is about empowering oneself with the knowledge and skills to protect against potential threats. It goes beyond just physical techniques—it includes awareness, de-escalation, and quick thinking. Self-defence training has given me confidence in my everyday life and the ability to respond calmly to challenging situations. It's about being prepared and taking responsibility for your own safety.</p>
